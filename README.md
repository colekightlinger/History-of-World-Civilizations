 <title> Younger Dryas Impact Theory </title>

<body>
<h1> Historical Argument: </h1>
<p>  Why do historians, archeologists, and geologists so vehemently reject new theories or hypothesis for ancient history when new evidence comes to light that supports these seemingly outlandish ideas, in this article we explore just one of these hypotheses called the the Younger Dryas Impact Theory and the scientific and historical world’s reaction to its proposed ideas.

<h2> Background </h2>
This hypothesis was first proposed in 2007 as a reason for why the Younger Dryas period happened in the first place and it was proposed that pieces of a comet exploded in Earth’s atmosphere above the Laurentide Ice Sheet. As previously mentioned new theories for old events tend to receive rejection until they can be proven with hard evidence as shown with the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs which is an idea that is now so widely accepted that it’s taught in textbooks was originally a laughed at idea back when it was proposed in the 1980’s (2).

<h3> The above primary source images display "Black Mat" layer </h3> 
The evidence produced for the theory came from geological samples of sediments dating back to the start of the Younger Dryas and within 6 of these sites where sample collection was done had a thin layer of organic-rich layers called black mats which are clearly visible in images 1-3 while images number 4 and 5 have a thinner but still visible black line marring the sediment layers in what seem like different areas sediment layers. 

<br> 

<p> While te debate about whether this theory is accurate or not is still ongoing there seem to be two different sides of this theory, one is whether it was possible for a commet to cause the Laurentide Ice Sheet collapsed while the other side is that there is not enough systematic evidence of the Younger Dryas impact Theory to conclude that it is real. When it was first itroduced back in 2007 it introduced a rush of scientific professionals to conduct their own independent studies on the possibilities described but most ended in failure as the "Black Mat" layers described in the initial Hypothesis was nowhere to be found upon independent research. As for the wildfire that they claimed coverd half the continent of North America, a charcoal expert, Jennifer Marlon, after 2 years of research was unable to find any evidence of the so called mass wildfires that such a celestial impact would have caused. This is just one side of the theory, on the other side is Allen West, a retired geophysicist who claims the experts contradicting this theory radiocarbon dated the spike in wildfires wrong and that their proposed 13,200 years was actually 12,800 years ago when the Younger Dryas period started.
