 <title> Younger Dryas Impact Theory </title>

<body>
<h1> Historical Argument: </h1>
<p>  Why do historians, archeologists, and geologists so vehemently reject new theories or hypothesis for ancient history when new evidence comes to light that supports these seemingly outlandish ideas, in this article we explore just one of these hypotheses called the the Younger Dryas Impact Theory and the scientific and historical world’s reaction to its proposed ideas.

<h2> Background </h2>
This hypothesis was first proposed in 2007 as a reason for why the Younger Dryas period happened in the first place and it was proposed that pieces of a comet exploded in Earth’s atmosphere above the Laurentide Ice Sheet. As previously mentioned new theories for old events tend to receive rejection until they can be proven with hard evidence as shown with the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs which is an idea that is now so widely accepted that it’s taught in textbooks was originally a laughed at idea back when it was proposed in the 1980’s (2).
